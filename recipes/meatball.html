    <h1>Meatball Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./images/image.webp" width="350" height="300"alt="">
    <dl>This is a recipe that can be quickly made in your air fryer. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and freeze for later use. I have included those directions in the notes. Dip meatballs in marinara, if desired.</dl>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces lean ground beef</li>
            <li>4 ounces ground pork</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine beef, pork, Italian seasoning, salt, garlic, egg, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs in a large bowl. Mix well until evenly combined. Form into 16 equally-sized meatballs using an ice cream scoop and place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place 1/2 of the meatballs in the basket of the air fryer and cook 8 minutes. Shake the basket and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer to a serving plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining meatballs.</li>
